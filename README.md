## About
This repo collects writeups, notes, screenshots and raw outputs for retired HTB machines and other lab exercises. Each machine gets its own folder containing a Markdown writeup, an `images/` folder for screenshots and an `outputs/` folder for raw command outputs (nmap, enum4linux, hashes, etc.).
